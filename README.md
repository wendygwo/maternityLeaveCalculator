## California Maternity Leave Calculator

### Overview

This is very much a work in progress. The purpose of this web app is to help families who are trying to figure out what job leave protections and pay the pregnant mother is entitled to under California law.

### Background

I was the first woman to go out on maternity leave at the startup I was working at when I had my son a few years ago. There was no family leave policy at my former company, and I wanted to make sure that I was maximizing my leave time and pay, because I wanted to ensure I had the most amount of time to bond with my newborn. From there, I dove into researching family leave law in California and at the Federal level, so I could let my company know what my plan was.

I found the process of figuring out what job protection and pay I was entitled to before going on maternity leave very confusing. I found one or two charts that were super helpful in providing examples of what protections and pay I was entitled to, but you still had to do the math yourself and hope you didn't make any mistakes.

This app is my attempt to make figuring out this information much easier, by doing all the calculations for you based on your answers to the questions presented. This is the app I wish had existed when I was pregnant.

### Disclaimer

I don't claim to be an expert of any sort and this app is still in a very preliminary state. Please open an issue if you find any incorrect information. Thanks!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
